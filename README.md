# OpenFilter: A Framework to Democratize Research Access to Social Media AR Filters

### 1. Open filter: the framework
Most of the AR filters available on social media platforms --such as Instagram, TikTok, SnapChat-- can only be applied in real-time on selfie images captured from the camera. Hence, it is challenging to carry out quantitative and systematic research on such filters. OpenFilter fulfills such a need by enabling the application of AR filters on publicly available datasets of faces.
