# Beautified Datasets

## FairBeauty
FairBeauty is a beautified version of the FairFace dataset. FairFace contains 108,501 face images, promoting algorithmic fairness in Computer Vision systems. The choice of this dataset is motivated by its focus on diversity and our will to identify a dataset that would be representative of the population of Instagram --which is a globalized social environment with over 800 million users in the world -- without biasing the results towards specific facial traits, gender or age ranges. Eight popular, AR beauty filters are applied on equal portions of the original dataset.

### Experiments


## B-LFW
B-LFW is a beautified version of the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset, a public benchmark dataset for face verification, designed for studying and evaluating unconstrained face recognition systems. This dataset contains more than 13,000 facial images of 1,680 different individual. In this work, we have beautified LFW with the same eight popular Instagram beauty filters, using different filters on different images from the same individuals.
